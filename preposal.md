# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A side scroller/top down view exploration game (like the mario track from mod 11)

A homepage, if I feel up to trying to code in java and html

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

no

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Overall I feel ok about the project, but if there is an example available that would be helpful.
